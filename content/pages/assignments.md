During Learning Weeks, students will work together to present teaching workshops, lessons, or hands-on demonstrations of the production, use, and interpretation of new media literacies. We’ll tap into each other’s expertise so that we can all experience collective intelligence in practice!

There will also be one final project. Students are expected to consult with the instructor one-on-one prior to the fourth week in the semester to discuss their goals for producing a project or paper in line with the themes of New Media Literacies. This project or paper and its steps will be agreed upon mutually between instructor and student and together they will come up with a plan and deadlines.
